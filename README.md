# Laboration 3 - DateConverter

This application is part of the course `1DV610 - Introduction to Software Quality` at [Linneaus University](https://lnu.se/), Sweden.

## DateConverter

 Should be an easy and painless way for users to quickly edit dates in longer articles/texts to fit a different calendar.
 DateConverter aims to be a seamless, non-confusing way for users to quickly convert dates in larger texts, or simply dates to different calendars.

## Usage

### Limitations

This app does not yet handle negative year conversions, meaning that it is currently not possible to convert a year from before BC using the Gregorian Calendar or to perform a conversion from before KÃµki 0.
